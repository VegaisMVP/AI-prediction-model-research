# üìä 01 ¬∑ Data Pipeline ‚Äî Foundation of Predictive Intelligence

> _‚ÄúNo AI model can outlearn the flaws of its data. In predictive betting, information precision defines profitability.‚Äù_

This module expands **Section¬†1 ¬∑ High-Quality Data Curation** of the main `README` and gives implementation-level detail.

---

## 1  Overview

The VEGAIS data pipeline builds a **low-latency knowledge graph** of sports events, odds flows and social signals.  
Let \( \mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, y_i)\} \) denote the curated dataset used to learn \( P_\theta(y \mid x) \).

## 2  Sources of Truth <a id="sources"></a>

| Data Class | Description | Primary Feed | Update Freq |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Match Metadata | league, kickoff, rosters | Sportradar API | 1 min |
| Live Stats | goals, xG, fouls, injuries | StatsPerform | 5 s |
| Betting Odds | pre-match & in-play lines | 25+ books (Bet365, Pinnacle) | ‚â§2 s |
| Social/News | lineup leaks, injuries | Twitter fire-hose, RSS | 30 s |
| On-chain Bets | wallet-level wagers | TON GraphQL | near-block |

*The **Betting Odds** feed is essential for ROI benchmarks listed in README ¬ß4.*

```

> ¬π *Feature Store aligns with the ‚ÄúFeature Store‚Äù node in the main README diagram.*  
> ¬≤ *Snapshot-hash protocol (¬ß5) fulfils the ‚ÄúEvery change hashed & tagged‚Äù guarantee in README ¬ß1.3.*

---

## 4  Annotation & Human‚ÄìAI Loop

We apply semi-supervised consensus:  
\[
L = \alpha\,L_{AI} + (1-\alpha)\,L_{Human},\quad \alpha = 0.6
\]

Resulting label accuracy ‚â• 96 % on hold-out (*matches README evaluation Œ∫ > 0.83*).

---

## 5  Governance & Versioning

All transformations emit SHA-256 hashes (DVC) ‚Üí immutable lineage.  
Each model in README ¬ß3 references a snapshot ID \( S_t \).

---

## 6  External Benchmarks

We align our pipeline outputs with public prediction datasets:
- StatsBomb xG Open Set [2]  
- Kaggle Football Results [3]  
- NFL Big Data Bowl [4]

Evaluation metrics (LogLoss, Brier) match README ¬ß4.

## 7  Engineering Stack

| Layer | Tooling | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Ingest | **Puppeteer**, **Playwright**, Scrapy | handles JS-heavy books |
| Stream | WebSockets + Kafka | 2 s end-to-end |
| Transform | Pandas / Polars | SIMD-optimised |
| Store | PostgreSQL + Weaviate | hybrid queries |
| Orchestrate | Airflow / Prefect | DAG versioning |
| Version | DVC, LakeFS | snapshot-hash |
| Monitor | Prometheus, Grafana | SLO alerts |

---

## 8  DevOps SLA

- Mean ingestion latency \(< 3\,\text{s}\)  
- Pipeline uptime 99.98 % (2025 Q1)  
- Canary tests track drift vs README ROI metrics.

## Appendix A ¬∑ Principles and Process of High-Quality Data Construction

Based on industry-standard practices and internal frameworks, VEGAIS defines high-quality data construction as a lifecycle process:

### A.1 Core Questions

- What are the fundamental principles of high-quality dataset construction?
- How should continuous training and fine-tuning datasets be structured in different industry contexts?
- Are there standardized pipelines and toolkits available to support this process?

### A.2 Construction Workflow

| Stage          | Sub-processes                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Pipeline**   | Data Collection ¬∑ Data Preprocessing ¬∑ Data Annotation ¬∑ Data Augmentation ¬∑ Data Evaluation ¬∑ Iteration & Optimization |
| **Build Phase**| Data Governance ¬∑ Dynamic Data Updates         |
| **Core Principles** | Quality ¬∑ Scale ¬∑ Relevance ¬∑ Diversity ¬∑ Timeliness ¬∑ Updateability |

This section reflects the internal lifecycle from raw ingestion to structured predictive training sets and continuous refreshment.

## Appendix B ¬∑ Sports Match Data Schema (Sample)

To support rich prediction tasks and betting strategy modeling, we define an extensible schema of sports match data categories and fields:

### B.1 Core Categories and Fields

| Category          | Field Name                  | Description |

- Compatible with public schemas such as [StatsBomb](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data) and [Opta API]
