# üßë‚Äçüß¨ Training Pipeline ‚Äî From Token to Tensor

> _"Not all training is equal. What matters is relevance, recurrence, and reinforcement."_

This document outlines the training workflow of the VEGAIS Prediction Engine, combining supervised learning, reinforcement signals, and modular deployment logic. All processes are optimized for low-latency inference and real-world reward alignment.

---

## üì¶ 1. Training Stages Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Raw Tokenised Tasks] --> B[Prompt Generator]
    B --> C[Supervised Fine-Tuning - SFT]
    C --> D[Reinforcement Learning - PPO]
    D --> E[Adapter Tuning - LoRA / QLoRA]
    E --> F[Quantised Checkpoint Output]
```

Each stage targets a specific aspect:
- **SFT** aligns model outputs to labelled prediction targets.
- **RLHF (PPO)** aligns model incentives to real-match outcomes (e.g. ROI, accuracy).
- **LoRA / QLoRA** enables lightweight parameter-efficient refinement.

> üìö _References:_
> - Schulman et al., "Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms" (2017)
> - Dettmers et al., "QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs" (ICML 2023)

> - OpenAI, "Fine-Tuning GPT-3 Models" (2022)
> - HuggingFace Blog: https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf

The above design ensures that the model does not merely memorize token-level correlations but instead generalizes based on high-fidelity data and market-aware feedback. The merged pipeline reduces deployment cost while maintaining inference robustness under distributional shifts.

A diagrammatic breakdown of the full branching merge is provided in Section 7.

## üß™ 2. Prompt Construction & Token Policy

### 2.1 Task Templates
| Task Type | Template Format | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Score Win Prediction | Q&A | "Who will win: Team A vs Team B?" ‚Üí ["Team A"] |
| Spread Betting Margin | Regression | "Predict score difference: A vs B" ‚Üí ["-4.5"] |
| Over/Under Odds | Classification | "Will total be over 215.5?" ‚Üí [Yes/No] |

### 2.2 Tokenisation Policy
- SentencePiece + BPE hybrid
- Domain keywords enforced via regex patterns
- Custom token dictionary for rare player/team names

---

## ü§™ 3. Curriculum & Feedback Loops

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start --> A[Base SFT Dataset]
    A --> B[Match ROI Feedback Collector]
    B --> C[Reward-weighted Replay Buffer]
    C --> D[RL Trainer: PPO / DPO]
    D --> E[Checkpoint Evaluation]
    E -->|If score‚Üë| F[Checkpoint Promotion]
    E -->|Else| A
```

- Rewards include: Prediction ROI, Hit Rate, Long-tail Recall.
- Poor predictions recycled into hard negatives.

### 3.1 Reinforcement Reward Function
Let \( p_{win}, p_{actual} \) be predicted and actual win probabilities, and \( r \) be bet outcome (1 for win, 0 for loss):

\[
\text{Reward} = \lambda_1 \cdot (1 - \text{LogLoss}(p_{win}, p_{actual})) + \lambda_2 \cdot \text{ROI}(r)
\]

Where:
- \( \lambda_1, \lambda_2 \) are tunable weight parameters.
- ROI = (Total Payout - Stake) / Stake.

## üß≠ 4. Multi-Objective Scheduling & Incremental Updates

> _‚ÄúThe real world changes. So must our models ‚Äî continuously, contextually, cost-effectively.‚Äù_

### 4.1 Multi-Agent RL Scheduling

The system deploys multiple strategy-specific RL agents, each optimized for a distinct objective:
- üìà **Profit Maximization Agent**
- üß† **Consistency Agent** (low variance)
- üéØ **Risk-Calibrated Agent**
- ü§ñ **Exploration Agent** (e.g., underrepresented leagues)

Agents use a distributed actor-critic architecture, feeding policy deltas into a central scheduler. Batch allocation is governed by:

\[
\text{Batch Allocation Score} = \alpha R_{agent} + \beta D_{novelty} - \gamma C_{cost}
\]

Where:
- \( R_{agent} \): Rolling reward per agent
- \( D_{novelty} \): Inverse domain frequency
- \( C_{cost} \): Estimated compute cost

---

### 4.2 Token Budgeted Training Scheduler

To avoid token overuse:
- **Adaptive Sampling** based on prior signal utility
- **Quota Enforcement** by task and domain
- **Early Stopping** on stagnation in BLEU or ROI

> üìò Liu et al., ‚ÄúToken-Efficient Curriculum Learning‚Äù, ACL 2023

---

### 4.3 Incremental Online Updates

The model supports:
- üîÅ **Streaming Fine-tuning** with recent match data
- üí° **LoRA-based Patch Updates**
- üì§ **Live Hot-swaps** via Router Snapshots

Trigger condition is based on:

\[
\text{Trigger} = \mathbb{1}_{\Delta \text{ROI} > \epsilon} \lor \mathbb{1}_{\text{Drift KL} > \delta}
\]

Where:
- \( \epsilon \): Threshold for ROI drop
- \( \delta \): KL-divergence-based drift

# üéØ 5. Model Evaluation & Online Scoring

> _"A model that cannot be trusted under fire is no model at all."_

This section outlines the comprehensive evaluation protocols and online scoring mechanisms used to measure and improve the VEGAIS Prediction Engine. We blend traditional statistical metrics with real-world reward feedback and model interpretability layers.

---

## üìä 5.1 Offline Evaluation Protocols

### 5.1.1 Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Brier Score** | Measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. Lower is better. |
| **Log Loss** | Penalizes false confident predictions. Lower is better. |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Reward per unit variance across predictions. Higher indicates stable returns. |
| **ROI Backtest** | Real-money simulated returns using historical odds and predictions. |

### 5.1.2 Stratified Evaluation
- League-Level Split (e.g., NBA, EPL, CSGO)
- Odds-Bucket Evaluation (e.g., <1.5, 1.5‚Äì2.5, >2.5)
- Event Type: W/L vs Handicap vs O/U

> üîç "No single metric suffices ‚Äî we blend for robustness."

**Visualization Sample:**
```mermaid
pie
    title Evaluation Metrics Distribution
    "Brier Score" : 25
    "Log Loss" : 20
    "Sharpe Ratio" : 30
    "ROI Backtest" : 25
```

**Example Evaluation Log**

```

### 5.2.1 ROI Simulation Layer
Simulates real-world payout using platform-specific odds. This allows for:
- Strategy pruning before deployment
- Profit-driven policy reranking

### 5.2.2 Drift & Anomaly Checks
We compute a rolling KL divergence window:

\[
\text{Drift}(t) = D_{KL}(P_t \Vert P_{t-1})
\]

If \( \text{Drift}(t) > \delta \), trigger model inspection or retraining cycle.

**ROI Over Time (Sample):**

## üß† 5.3 Model Interpretability Toolkit

We use a hybrid framework for explainable predictions:
- **SHAP Values**: For local token/feature attributions
- **Counterfactual Prediction**: What-if simulation for outcomes
- **Model Delta Explainers**: Track logic shifts post-update

> _"Trust emerges when you can see why the model said what it said."_

## üö¶ 5.4 Evaluation Infrastructure

- **Batch Eval Harness** (on eval GPUs)
- **Live ROI Oracle** (linked to testnet odds execution)
- **Red Team Simulator** (adversarial testing for jailbreaks)

## üßΩ 6. RL Training Scheduler

> _"Scheduling is strategy. An optimal agent emerges not just from training, but from **when**, **what**, and **how** it trains."_

This module outlines the reinforcement learning (RL) training scheduler architecture for VEGAIS's multi-agent AI prediction system. We define how training episodes are scheduled, prioritized, distributed, and merged under various compute and data constraints.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è 6.1 Training Time Budgeting

We segment compute allocation by token budget and expected information gain (EIG):

```math
B_t = \sum_i \gamma_i \cdot \text{EIG}(x_i)
```

Where:
- \( B_t \): Token budget at step \( t \)
- \( \gamma_i \): Scheduling weight of instance \( i \)
- \( \text{EIG}(x_i) \): Expected information gain of training sample \( x_i \)

---

## üß† 6.2 Multi-Agent RL Job Pool

We maintain isolated RL agents for different market abstractions (e.g., Draw, Handicap, Over/Under). Each agent operates under PPO/DPO or quantile regression rewards, and training is scheduled conditionally on market drift or ROI drops.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[RL Scheduler] --> B[Job Pool]
    B --> C1["Agent-A (Draw Model)"]
    B --> C2["Agent-B (Handicap Model)"]
    B --> C3["Agent-C (OU Model)"]
    C1 --> D1[GPU Slot 1]
    C2 --> D2[GPU Slot 2]
    C3 --> D3[GPU Slot 3]
```

**Policy Update Snapshot:**
```json
{
  "agent": "Agent-A",
  "model_version": "v2.6-draw",
  "reward_delta": +0.023,
  "token_used": 91234,
  "stopped_early": false
}
```

---

## üì¶ 6.3 Curriculum Scheduler

We use a multi-phase curriculum that promotes data by reward surprise and regret minimization.

| Phase | Criteria | Sample Focus | Duration |
|-------|----------|---------------|----------|
| 1     | Entropy ‚Üë | Broad exploration | 10% epochs |
| 2     | Regret ‚Üì | Mid-difficulty strategy updates | 40% epochs |
| 3     | ROI ‚Üë    | High-stakes events | 50% epochs |

Each sample is weighted by a reward-surprise coefficient:

```math
w_i = \lambda \cdot |r_i - \hat{r}_i|
```

---

## üîÄ 6.4 Policy Merging & Conflict Resolution

- **Gradient Averaging**: All agents share policy heads. Gradients are averaged if loss divergence < \( \theta \)
- **Softmax Conflict Gate**: If divergence exceeds threshold, a soft conflict gate reweights conflicting updates

```math
\nabla_{merged} = \text{Softmax}(\alpha_i \cdot \nabla_i)
```

Where \( \alpha_i \) is derived from recent agent performance.

---

## üîÑ 6.5 Online‚ÄìOffline Sync Loop

Periodic parameter uploads to production models are based on offline reward simulation and live A/B test deltas:

| Sync Trigger | Metric Threshold | Delay |
|--------------|------------------|--------|
| Sim ROI ‚Üë    | +2.5% vs prod    | 6 hrs  |
| Red-team     | Fail rate < 0.5% | 12 hrs |

---

## üß™ 6.6 Evaluation + Logging

- Live Reward Monitor
- Agent-specific Logging with winrate & ROI curves
- Distributed Checkpoint Merger

> üìà Example Log:
```json
{
  "agent": "handicap-v2",
  "epoch": 47,
  "winrate": 0.612,
  "roi_7d": 9.8,
  "regret": 0.034
}
```

## üîÅ 7. Model Merging & Knowledge Distillation

> _"In knowledge transfer, compression is not loss ‚Äî it's synthesis."_

This section documents the architecture and techniques used to unify multiple models, transfer knowledge across tasks and modalities, and distill ensemble performance into compact, production-grade models.

---

## üß† 7.1 Distillation Protocols

We apply distillation in two modes:

- **Offline Logit Distillation**
- **Online Streaming Teacher Signal**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Ensemble Teacher] -->|Soft Labels| B[Student Model]
    B --> C[Distilled Inference Graph]
    C --> D[Lite Deployment Target]
```

### Loss Formulation
\[ 
\mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} = (1 - \alpha) \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}} + \alpha \cdot T^2 \cdot \text{KL}(\sigma(z_T/T) \Vert \sigma(z_S/T))
\]
Where:
- \( T \) is temperature
- \( z_T \) = teacher logits, \( z_S \) = student logits
- \( \alpha \) balances hard vs soft targets

---

## üîÄ 7.2 Branch Merging Strategies

We merge specialist branches (Draw, Handicap, OU) into a single MoE-style student:

- Representation Alignment using CCA
- Cross-task Attention Grafting
- Shared Bottleneck Compression

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Draw Branch] --> D[Align Layer]
    B[Handicap Branch] --> D
    C[OU Branch] --> D
    D --> E[Unified Student Model]
```

---

## üåê 7.3 Cross-Lingual & Multi-Modal Knowledge Transfer

We apply multilingual training using language-agnostic embeddings (LaBSE), and integrate tabular ‚Üí text prompts for odds + context fusion.

### Modality Conversion:
```json
{
  "match": "NBA Finals",
  "features": {
    "team_A_score": 102,
    "team_B_score": 98,
    "odds_A": 1.75,
    "odds_B": 2.05
  },
  "prompt": "Given the scores and odds, what is the confidence for Team A win?"
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è 8. Distributed Training Stack

> _‚ÄúTrain big. Train fast. Train everywhere.‚Äù_

This section outlines the distributed infrastructure VEGAIS employs to ensure scalable and fault-tolerant training across GPU clusters, optimized for cost, redundancy, and throughput.

---

## üåê 8.1 Infrastructure Overview

    D1 -->|Sync Gradients| A1

```

We employ hybrid **DP + MP + PP** (Data/Model/Pipeline Parallelism) for optimal utilization.

| Technique | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Data Parallelism** | Batches split across replicas; gradients averaged. |
| **Model Parallelism** | Shards large models (beyond GPU VRAM). |

cf = model.predict(team_a, odds=1.8)
bias_delta = abs(orig - cf)
assert bias_delta < threshold
```

---

## üîÑ 10.3 Evolution & Replacement Logic

```python
for strategy in candidate_pool:
    score = RL_eval(strategy)
    if score > baseline + delta:
        promote(strategy)
    else:
        schedule_for_retrain(strategy)
```

Strategies underperforming 3 consecutive rounds are replaced via fine-tuned offspring of top-performing peers.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 10.4 AutoML Controller Scoring Model

- Input features: reward history, usage distribution, volatility index
- Objective: maximise expected reward + entropy regularisation

```math
\text{Score}(S) = \mathbb{E}[R(S)] + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{H}(S)
```

Where \( \mathcal{H}(S) \) is the entropy of predictions from strategy S across diverse game types.

## üì° 11. Data Drift Detection & Self‚Äã-Healing

> _"When the environment shifts, the model must adapt ‚Äî or decay."_

This module describes the infrastructure and techniques used to detect data drift and apply self-healing mechanisms to ensure the robustness of AI predictions in dynamic sports environments.

## üîç 11.1 Drift Types & Detection Signals

| Drift Type        | Signal Source        | Description                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Concept Drift     | Label distribution   | Change in mapping from features to outcome   |
| Data Drift        | Feature histogram    | Input distribution change (e.g., odds shift) |
| Reward Drift      | Model feedback loop  | Shift in reward return under same policy     |
| Odds Anomaly      | Bookmaker deviation  | Unexpected bookmaker odds divergence         |

## ‚ôªÔ∏è 11.3 Self-Healing Response Engine

| Trigger Condition       | Response Type     | Mechanism Description                          |
|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Drift Score > 0.65      | Retrain           | Re-initiate fine-tuning on buffered samples    |
| Drift Spike             | Rollback          | Revert to previous checkpoint                  |
| Volatility > threshold  | Ensemble Activate | Switch to model ensemble voting mechanism      |

**Drift Score Computation Formula:**

\[
\text{DriftScore} = D_{KL}(P_{t} \parallel P_{t-1}) + \alpha \cdot |\mu_t - \mu_{t-1}|
\]

Where \( D_{KL} \) is the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence, \( \mu \) is mean outcome.

## ü§ñ 12. Online Incremental Update & Token‚Äã-Budget Scheduler

> _"The model that learns forever never decays."_

This module presents our framework for performing online incremental learning on streaming sports data while respecting token computation budgets and system constraints.

---

## üîÑ 12.1 Online Update Framework

In sports prediction, incoming data (matches, odds, player updates) flows in continuously. Rather than batch retraining, we update incrementally using a fine-tuned version of continual learning techniques.

    F --> G[Updated Weights Registry]
```

## üß† 12.2 Token-Budget Scheduling Strategy

Each update consumes a token budget. To optimize training utility:

### Scheduling Heuristics
| Parameter | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Importance Score | Prioritize updates with high impact | Entropy of prediction delta |
| Token Cost | Approximate update cost | Tokens √ó FLOPs estimate |
| Update Urgency | Time since last update | Streaming window timestamp |

We define the utility-to-cost ratio:

\[
\text{UtilityRatio} = \frac{\Delta \text{Accuracy}}{\text{TokenCost}} = \frac{Acc_{t+1} - Acc_t}{T_{used}}
\]

Only updates with UtilityRatio above threshold \( \tau \) are scheduled.

## üîß 12.3 Implementation Details

- **Fine-Tuner**: QLoRA adapter layers on full model backbone
- **Scheduler**: Priority queue driven by token budget and time constraints
- **Delta Detector**: KL divergence + confidence drop triggers
- **Checkpointing**: Updated weights pushed via Feature Store sync
